Telegram bot to display the weather in any city.

If you want to use this bot for your own purposes, so that other users can use it. You need to clone it, if you want to use it with the same telegram channel that is currently used, then here is the @WeatherAtlassBot link.
By clicking on this link, you turn on the software itself and write the city, for example, Paris, after which there will be a message how many degrees and how cloudy it is now. If you want to connect your bot, then you need to generate your token and find the client line in line 13 of the Program.cs class and change the token there (the token can be generated in the same BotFather)
